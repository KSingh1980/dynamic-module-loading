# Main Application

* This project was based on some work done by Thibaud Arnault: https://github.com/webshell/materia-sendgrid
* The addon module is now served using http-server and the main application runs in a browser instead of Electron.
* Some extraneous code was removed and the package files are updated to use the latest Angular 5.2.
* The webpack.config file is a newly created Angular 5.2 project ejected, no additional changes.
